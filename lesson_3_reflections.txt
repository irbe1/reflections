--When would you want to use a remote rather than keeping all your work local?
When the project is being developed in collaboration with others. Also, when you just want
to make code accessible and/or invite people to collaborate.

--Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-data with your remote repository?
If it is code, it would matter for me to know what it does. I would not want some
unexpected change to appear suddenly which may also not be compatible with the 
changes I have made myself and not pushed yet.

--Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
Forking is GitHub-specific version of cloning- allows to copy a repository someone
else has made on GitHub on your own GitHub account. That would be useful if you
want to create own version of someone else's project, either for own use or also
to suggest some changes to it. Because fork is created on your GitHub account it
allows other people to contribute to it, etc.
Clones allow to create a local copy of either someone else's repository or your
own repository. Useful if you want a copy of a project on your own computer to
work on it locally and possibly push the changes back to remote when ready.
Branches are alternative versions of project within the same repository. Useful
when experimenting and/or developing alternatives. Branches can also be merged into
main version when ready.
