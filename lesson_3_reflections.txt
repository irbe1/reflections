--When would you want to use a remote rather than keeping all your work local?
When the project is being developed in collaboration with others. Also, when you just want
to make code accessible and/or invite people to collaborate.

--Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-data with your remote repository?
If it is code, it would matter for me to know what it does. I would not want some
unexpected change to appear suddenly which may also not be compatible with the 
changes I have made myself and not pushed yet.
