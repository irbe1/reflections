--What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a repository is initialized a .git repository appears in it with some default
subdirectories. I guess this is needed so that further git operations such as adding
a commit can be performed- there are directories where to add the relevant metadata.
After a git repository is initialized it is also possible to use git status- so 
the contents of the directory has already been 'registered'- git has started tracking them?

--How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is different from the working area in that it only has those files
that are to be commited to the repository in the next commit. It is different from
the repository in that files can be added/taken away. This allows for more flexibility
in choosing what to commit- because all files to be commited are seen in one place
and then can also be modified.
